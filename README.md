# Restful-API-using-NODE-JS-and-Express-JS
Created a books API that gets all programming books. I used Postman to update, delete, add, getbooks id. You can edit all files through Postman, VS studio, MongoDB compass
To run the app download all files on to desktop computer and run on localhost: 8080 to view what get outputed.
